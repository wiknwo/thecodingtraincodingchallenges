# What is The Coding Train?

The Coding Train is a YouTube channel run by Daniel Shiffman where the main focus is to create educational videos on how to program in Processing and p5.js.
The method used in these educational videos is a practical one that usually takes the form of coding challenges where Daniel will write a program to achieve
some goal or create some visualization and the viewer programs along in a sort of virtual pair programming manner.
